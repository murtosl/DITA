Task: Write a post with Prose.IO


John:

What is the Business Goal?

Who Performs the Task?

What does the User Need To Know About the Task?


Cindy:
 
What Task Does the User need to perform to Accomplish the Goal?

When and Under What Conditions is The Task Performed?

What is the Sequence of Tasks?
 
 
Sarah:

What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?

  Mental: Deciding the content and organization of the document. Deciding the proper location for the document.
  
  Physical: Clicking buttons, typing, reading.
  
What are the potential distractions to accomplishing this goal?

  Troubleshooting: User does not have GitHub account. User cannot grant access to repo (Permissions Issue). 
  
  Alternative Path: Write the post directly on GitHub, rather than with Prose.
  
  Exception Path: Loss of internet connection or power. Prose site is down. China launches a mutli-day DDOS attack on GitHub. (http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/github-battles-largest-ddos-in-sites-history-targeted-at-anti-censorship-tools/).
  
What is the expected result?

The post written will appear on GitHub and be properly formatted.
