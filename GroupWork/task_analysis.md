Task: Write a post with Prose.IO


John:

What is the Student’s Goal? 
The Student’s goal is to post a document to the WRIT 4662w Github repository site, where anyone who has access to the group’s profile can share their comments on the content of the document and add their own regarding a similar thread.  In this way we will complete our assessment of the week’s readings, practice the tasks we need to in order to become better technical communicators, and get and give feedback to those we are learning beside.

Who Performs the Task? 
The graduate and undergraduate students of the Department of Writing Studies (and similar departments) at the University of Minnesota’s College of Arts and Sciences (team, can you confirm that last part?) This is a group ranging from active professional experience using advanced web-based technologies to those who have only used those which they might need for school work and play.

What does the User Need To Know About the Task?
User needs to know that every time they make a change, they are effectively submitting a new document into Github. They will still be then able to see past versions of their document on the site, but any comments made on the previous submissions will be left with that version of the document.  In other words, if you make a major change to a document, and don’t know why you are not seeing the feedback on Github, that could be a reason.

When and Under What Conditions is The Task Performed?

Limitations- Students will need to know how to operate their computer, how to navigate the web using a browser, and what message they want to convey in their post.

Sarah:

What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?

  Mental: Deciding the content and organization of the document. Deciding the proper location for the document.
  
  Physical: Clicking buttons, typing, reading.
  
What are the potential distractions to accomplishing this goal?

  Troubleshooting: User does not have GitHub account. User cannot grant access to repo (Permissions Issue). 
  
  Alternative Path: Write the post directly on GitHub, rather than with Prose.
  
  Exception Path: Loss of internet connection or power. Prose site is down. China launches a mutli-day DDOS attack on GitHub. (http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/github-battles-largest-ddos-in-sites-history-targeted-at-anti-censorship-tools/).
  
What is the expected result?

The post written will appear on GitHub and be properly formatted.
