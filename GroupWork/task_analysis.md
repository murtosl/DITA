Sarah:

What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?

  Mental: Deciding the content and organization of the document. Deciding the proper location for the document.
  
  Physical: Clicking buttons, typing, reading.
  
What are the potential distractions to accomplishing this goal?

  Troubleshooting: User does not have GitHub account. User cannot grant access to repo (Permissions Issue). 
  
  Alternative Path: Write the post directly on GitHub, rather than with Prose.
  
  Exception Path: Loss of internet connection or power. Prose site is down. China launches a mutli-day DDOS attack on GitHub. (http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/github-battles-largest-ddos-in-sites-history-targeted-at-anti-censorship-tools/).
  
What is the expected result?

The post written will appear on GitHub and be properly formatted.
